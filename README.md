# AlgoViz

A pathfinding-algorithm visualizer. Paint walls on a grid, place start/goal markers, then
watch a pathfinding algorithm (or generate a maze) animate step by step on canvas.

- **Algorithms**: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Bidirectional BFS, Dijkstra's
- **Maze / pattern generators**: Recursive Division (+ vertical/horizontal skew), Prim's,
  Randomized Depth-First Search, Random Walls
- **Controls**: Visualize, Pause/Step, Clear path, speed presets (slow/medium/fast)
- **Editing**: drag to draw walls, drag starting on a wall to erase (or right-click / Alt), drag
  the start and goal markers to move them
- **Legend and live stats**: what each colour means, plus the run's status, visited cells and
  path length
- **Built-in guide**: an "About" dialog (opens on the first visit) explaining how to use it and
  how each algorithm behaves
- **Responsive**: works on phones, tablets and desktops; touch to draw walls, and the grid is
  sized to the screen on load (resizing rescales it without losing your walls)
