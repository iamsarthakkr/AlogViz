// getGridSnapshot: freezes a plain-data copy of the current grid for an algorithm run.
// Returns null if start/goal aren't valid, which is what silently no-ops Visualize/Step.
// Both marker cells get DEFAULT_WEIGHT in the copy: their weights can't change the route (no path
// enters the start, every path enters the goal once), and doing it here spares every algorithm a special case.
