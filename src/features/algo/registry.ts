// registry: the single list of pathfinding algorithms and their metadata. Adding an algorithm means
// adding one entry here; everything else is derived from this list, so nothing can fall out of sync.
// - Array order is the dropdown order; algoRegistry[0] is the default selection
// - algorithmMap is what the controller takes, so the controller doesn't depend on the registry shape
// - The contract suite (tests/features/algo/index.test.ts) runs over every entry automatically
